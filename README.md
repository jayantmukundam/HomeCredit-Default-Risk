# HomeCredit-Default-Risk
Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. And, unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders.
Home Credit strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. 
In order to make sure this underserved population has a positive loan experience, Home Credit makes use of a variety of alternative data--including telco and transactional information--to predict their clients' repayment abilities.
Given certain parameters related to client's background which describes their financial condition, the task is to make a decision whether to grant loan to the client or not.
This is a classification problem where we need to classify into two categories 0 and 1.
- 0: Loan grant accepted.
- 1: Loan grant rejected.

1) Model used - LGBM
2) Evaluation - AUC-ROC
